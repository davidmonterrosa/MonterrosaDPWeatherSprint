## PEER REVIEW

Peer Reviewed By: Hassan Sajid
>Review: The design was not a choice for us in the project but you did a good job on creating something that looks very similar to the figma's that we were given. The search function works great and you are able to switch between locations on search with no issues. Adding and removing cities to favorites work as well. The favorited locations are then shown in a popup favorites section with a press of a button which works smoothly. The locations also work when they are clicked in the favorites. Overall, great work on this project. Your code looks very well polished as well. Good job!
